-- Phase 07: API scope registry and access control.
--
-- A scope is a permission to call a PesaGuard API. It is NOT an implementation of
-- that API, and it is NOT the same thing as an RBAC permission:
--
--   scope      webhooks:read   -> what a credential may call over the API
--   permission webhook:read    -> what a human may do in the developer portal
--
-- Keeping the two namespaces separate is deliberate. Conflating them would mean
-- revoking a portal permission silently revoked API access, or granting a portal
-- permission granted API access the credential was never scoped for.
--
-- The registry is seeded here and owned by code. Rows may be annotated (a scope may
-- be deprecated or restricted by an operator) but a scope is never invented at
-- runtime: an unknown scope is rejected, not created, so a typo in a client
-- integration fails loudly instead of silently granting nothing.
