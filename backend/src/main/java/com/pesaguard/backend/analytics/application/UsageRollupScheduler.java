/**
 * Drives the rollup ladder on a schedule.
 *
 * <p>Each level runs on its own cadence, matched to how quickly it is read. Minute
 * buckets are for live dashboards and roll up every minute; hourly and above
 * back longer-range reports and run less often.
 *
 * <p>Minutes are aggregated <b>after</b> hours on purpose. Rolling up an hour
 * before all its minutes exist would produce an hourly total that is then
 * silently wrong, and nothing would go back and fix it — recomputation only
 * happens for windows the worker revisits.
 *
 * <p>Enabled by {@code pesaguard.usage.rollup-enabled}. Off by default in tests
 * so a suite is not racing a background thread.
