/**
 * Buffers request events and hands them to a writer off the request thread.
 *
 * <p>Usage tracking must never be able to slow down or fail the request it is
 * measuring. A synchronous insert would add a database round trip to the latency
 * of every API call, and a momentary database problem would turn an analytics
 * outage into an outage of the payment API. So recording is enqueue-only on the
 * request thread and the write happens on a background thread.
 *
 * <p>The queue is <b>bounded</b>. An unbounded queue is not a safe default: under
 * sustained overload it grows until the heap is exhausted, and the resulting
 * {@code OutOfMemoryError} takes down the payment API — the exact outcome this
 * class exists to prevent.
 *
 * <p>When the queue is full the event is <b>dropped and counted</b>, never
 * silently discarded. {@link #droppedCount()} is exposed for monitoring; a
 * non-zero value means usage data is incomplete and someone should look at it.
 * Dropping a usage sample is strictly better than the alternatives: the request
 * still succeeds, and the loss is bounded, visible, and recoverable by
 * re-aggregation from application logs. Silently losing the data, or blocking
 * the caller, would both be worse.
