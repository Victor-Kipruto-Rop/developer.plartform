# Event Registry and Subscriptions

**This phase is partially built.** The event registry, subscriptions and delivery
tracking domain are complete, schema-backed and tested. The services,
repositories, controllers and the dispatch worker are not yet written.

## What is built

| Component | State |
| --- | --- |
| Event type name grammar | **Complete and tested** |
| Registry entry: description, schema, category, version | **Complete and tested** |
| Lifecycle and deprecation with a sunset gate | **Complete and tested** |
| Subscriptions: filters, version, endpoint, status, environment | **Complete and tested** |
| Delivery tracking per attempt | **Complete and tested** |
| `V11` schema and seeded catalog | Written, never executed |
| Services, repositories, controllers | Not built |
| Dispatch worker | Not built |

## Event names

Names are `namespace.entity.action`, or `namespace.entity.path.action` for a
nested entity. The namespace is the first segment and the action is always the
last.

```
developer.project.created
developer.api_key.revoked
developer.webhook.delivery.failed     <- nested: entity is webhook.delivery
```

Segments are lowercase with hyphens and underscores, 2–32 characters. Three
segments minimum, four maximum.

### The grammar is a security control

Event names reach delivery headers, log lines and metric labels. A name carrying
a newline, a space or a quote is a log-injection and metric-poisoning hazard, so
the grammar rejects all of them, along with uppercase (never silently folded) and
the `*` wildcard, which is a subscription-filter concept rather than a name.

### This grammar was wrong twice

Both were caught by tests, and both would have shipped a registry that rejected
## Lifecycle and deprecation

```
DRAFT --activate--> ACTIVE --deprecate--> DEPRECATED --retire--> RETIRED
```

| State | Emitted | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DRAFT` | no | Registered but not yet emitted |
| `ACTIVE` | yes | |
| `DEPRECATED` | **yes, until sunset** | Subscribers are told what to migrate to |
| `RETIRED` | no | Terminal |

### Deprecation is not removal

A deprecated event keeps being emitted until its sunset date. Silently stopping a
published event breaks every live integration that subscribed to it, and an outage
is not a deprecation strategy.

Deprecating requires a sunset date. A deprecation with no end leaves subscribers
guessing whether the event is still coming.

### Retirement is gated on the date, not on confidence

`retire()` is **refused** before the sunset date. This is the rule that stops an
operator breaking integrations by retiring an event early, however sure they are
that nobody subscribes to it.

Emission stops at sunset even before the retirement sweep runs, so a late or absent
sweep cannot keep an event alive past the date subscribers were promised.

## Versioning

Every event carries a version, and every subscription **pins** one. If
`developer.project.created` moves to v2 by gaining a field, a subscriber pinned to
v1 keeps receiving the v1 shape. Without pinning, a routine additive change
silently alters what integrators parse.

## Subscriptions

A subscription names an event, pins its version, targets an endpoint, and is bound
to a project and optionally an environment. A null environment means "every
environment in the project".

Status is `ACTIVE`, `SUSPENDED` or `CANCELLED` (terminal).

### Filters can only narrow

Filter keys are an allowlist: `projectId`, `environmentId`, `resourceType`,
`resourceId`, `status`. All filters must match (AND).

Two rules that matter:

- **`organizationId` is not filterable.** A subscription is created for one tenant
  and no filter can widen that. This is what stops a subscriber reaching another
  organization's events by crafting a filter.
- **A missing key does not match.** If an event lacks a filtered attribute it is
  not delivered, rather than being delivered on an assumed value. A financial
  event delivered to the wrong webhook is not a recoverable mistake.

## Delivery tracking

Every attempt is a row. Attempts are never overwritten, so "how many times did
this fail, and what did the endpoint say each time?" stays answerable.

Tracked per attempt: event ID, subscription ID, delivery ID, attempt number,
timestamp, status, response code and excerpt, latency, and the next attempt time.

Status is `PENDING`, `IN_FLIGHT`, `DELIVERED`, `RETRY_SCHEDULED`, `FAILED`,
`DEAD_LETTERED` or `SUPPRESSED`.

The table is **append-only** — the database rejects updates and deletes. The DLQ is
evidence that something failed and a person must look; a delivery log that can be
edited is not evidence.

Response bodies are stored as truncated excerpts only, so the delivery table does
not become a second copy of integration payloads that nobody thinks to apply
retention to.

## What has NOT been built

- **No services, repositories or controllers.** The domain is complete; nothing
  persists or exposes it yet.
- **No dispatch worker.** No code enumerates subscribers, matches filters or
  attempts delivery.
- **No payload validation against the registered schema.** Schemas are stored and
  versioned but nothing validates a payload against them on emit.
- **No event emission.** Nothing yet publishes an event when a project is created
  or a key is revoked.
- **No replay or manual retry API** for dead-lettered deliveries.
- **No OpenAPI entries or RBAC permissions** for events.

## Verification status

- Domain behaviour is covered by tests, including the seeded-catalog guard.
- **NOT TESTED against PostgreSQL.** `V11` has never executed. The check
  constraints, foreign keys, the append-only trigger and the seed are all
  **unverified**. Docker is unavailable in this environment.
- **The migration version sequence skips V8.** There is no `V8__*`; Flyway tolerates
  this, but adding one later would be an out-of-order migration and would need
  `outOfOrder` handling or renumbering.
- **Uncommitted** — the working directory is entirely untracked and CI has never
  run.
its own catalog:

1. The first grammar disallowed underscores, so `developer.api_key.created` — one
   of the platform's own event names — was refused.
2. The second required exactly three segments, so `developer.webhook.delivery.failed`
   was refused.

`everySeededEventNameSatisfiesTheGrammar` now asserts every seeded name parses, so
the grammar and the catalog cannot drift apart again.
